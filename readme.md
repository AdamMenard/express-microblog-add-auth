**Objective:** Use Node, Express, and MongoDB to build a full-stack micro-blog application.

## Minimum Requirements

* A server with RESTful API routes for blog posts.
* Request specs for each of your API routes.
* A persistent database to store blog posts. Blog posts should at minimum have a `title` and `description`.
* A client that uses AJAX and Handlebars templating to `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` blog posts. **A user should be able to:**
  * See a list of all blog posts
  * Create a new blog post
  * Update an existing blog post
  * Delete an existing blog post
* A pleasing a logical user experience (take advantage of Bootstrap!)

## Bonus

* Validations and error-handling
* Build a "likes" functionality
* Add a "category" attribute to your blog posts. When a user clicks on a category, take them to a page that displays all the blog posts that have that category.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo, and clone it into your `develop` folder on your local machine.

## Submission

* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
* Once you've finished the assignment and pushed your work to GitHub, make a pull request from your fork to the original repo.
